# DSCom: Data-Driven Self-Adaptive Community-Based Influence Maximization Framework
DSCom for Influence Maximization. 
The main contribution of our work is to extend the original Influence Maximization problem to a relaxed one, with diffusion model unknown.

## 1. Diffusion Dataset Generation
A simulation of the influence spread in the reality. A diffusion dataset will be generated based on the diffusion model given or generated randomly.
Use 'diffusion_gen.py' to generate diffusion dataset.
